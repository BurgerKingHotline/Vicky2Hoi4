The Victoria 2 to Hearts of Iron 4 mod project is essential End of the New Beginning but is more of a mod for people messing around with friends and the such. It's basically how the old and new Millennium Dawn work.

With this project we expect to add in more as we go along the way (we have only five devs and a few helpers currently), such as:
Custom expansive focus trees
More decisions
Improved colonization
More African nations
African colonization
More GFX (portraits mainly)
Scripted GUIs

The mod is in a very alpha state with only countries and basic colonization in right now. It's still fun to fuck around in it though with other mods though so uh

Yea have fun and stuff, make sure to not commit genocide! (or declare war on the "uncolonized land" nation thingo!)
